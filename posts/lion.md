For our latest Identity work, we visited expert coffee roasters, Skuratov.

After contacting us initially, we immediately felt at home with this project, as the brief was smooth and clear, which enabled us to action their branding refresh.

Skuratov let us know early on that they wanted this update to reflect their current ideals, as well as being something that remains consistent with their brand. This helped us a lot in being able to approach this project with confidence.

We kicked things off with their new logo concept.

The idea behind the logo was to make it more clear and defined, giving it a chance to cut through all the noise and perceptions that come with traditional coffee roasters and cafes today.

As you can see, we’ve created a monogram, which consists of their name. But now this monogram can now be used for various signage and print materials, and not just for digital formats.

Skuratov pride themselves on their craft and really know that they’re doing when it comes to making a good brew. So in turn, this adult approach to their identity helped with our art direction.

Inspired by their american style cafe decor and interior-design, we felt it was important to keep this aspect consistent in our work.

Taking this in our stride, we also wanted to search for environmentally friendly materials that would help compliment their new identity. This is something Skuratov had specifically asked for us to do. It’s not the usual kind of thing we get, but we’re glad we had that chance because it helped us think on a new level — almost like multidimensional design, if you will.
This type of tangible design isn’t something we always get a chance at working with, so it was great to be able to have this opportunity.
We didn’t just think about the materials themselves, but also the shape of these materials, as this would also add certain nuances towards the identity.

We definitely felt that this project was a little more challenging in the sense that we really enjoyed working on this new identity, and the process of elimination (choosing which of our favorite designs set we would choose) was the hardest part! Thankfully, we came to that decision and were super happy with it.
As mentioned earlier, it was important that we didn’t completely overhaul their identity. We decided to keep some of their existing design inventory, illustrations and current copywriting which they had been using.
In terms of colour pallette — we added a fresh new take.

Skuratov’s old branding was made up of a rather dark palette that was mainly based around a darker tone of red. We’ve substituted that red, for a more lively orange.
This orange brings breathes so much more more life into the updated design set. And by only making one small change in colour, it changed the whole complextion of the visual identity.
In short, we really had fun with Skuratov’s new identity. In particular, the monogram, as it’s quite layered in its approach and has more than one meaning to it.

Now, Skuratov have an identity which we believe is much more modern, individual and identified. Keeping them in front of common crowd.
