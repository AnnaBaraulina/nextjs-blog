Moskvich Mag is a publication that’s been a part of Moscow’s cultural lifestyle scene since we can all remember.

It’s focus has always been on the reader, and in particular, people with busy lifestyles, a taste for film, art, food & more.

We wanted to stay true to MM’s humble beginnings, and keep some of that classic, tangible feeling within their revamped web and branding design.

In our latest digital and branding project, we discuss how we approached the sites functionality, our favourite features, and the ways in which we were able to actualise this project.

Branding
The branding aspect was really interesting for us because we have all grown up in Moscow, and have a deep understanding of its diverse cultural, and social groups. This is definitely something that allowed us to access new creative angles that perhaps many others wouldn’t be able to.

Moscow is such a unique city. At times, it can feel small and cluttered, but on the contrary, it can also feel extremely vast and gigantic. From its city landscapes and suburban architecture, it’s a city that’s perceived differently by every individual.

MM allows people to learn about selected stories referring to hip cafes, underground tales, chic galleries and a whole host of other hidden gems across Moscow and its outlying communities.

The site also features some bold choices in typography. We used this combination to try and make it adapt to a sense of the old Moscow. For example, Stalininksi (Stalinist) style architecture. If you’re familiar with it, you already know how some of these architectural behemoths were built — super tall and strong, as well as really making their presence really felt. But we didn’t want to focus on this too heavily, as it was just important to acknowledge this classical aspect within our art direction.

For the logo, we used Rainer, whilst mixing up our text array and headlines with Panama and Cofo Robert and Steinbeck.

It’s still very strict, and conservative, whilst being adaptive and very intelligent.
We wanted to make sure the site functioned with cohesion, so we had to make sure our branding complemented the sites usability.

Website
We had lots of fun playing around with the websites concept.

Every day, when you’re presented with new content about Moscow’s lifestyle scene, the background will be shown in a different colour, representing the current day of the week. This will then continue for the rest of the week, with each day having its own unique colour code.

As it’s a media site with a really broad readership, especially those in their middle ages, we worked tirelessly at creating a structure that allows all content to be super focused at all times.
Amongst many common media sites today, it’s so easy to become lost and frustrated whilst reading when you’re having to deal with a cluttered interface.

How many times have you read something interesting on one of your favourite online publications, and wanted to go back to it or share with a friend, and not been able to find it? Too many times.

We wanted to ease people from this type of headache.
So, in order to take this idea further, we decided to take a couple steps backwards in time.

We focused on bringing more tangible and traditional reading elements to the fray, like a hand-held magazine.

With a magazine, you can flip through the pages easily, and be reminded by certain clues, which can help you find what you want. Or, go back to it 1 week, or a month later because you just know that it’s going to be there.
