subtitle: 'Let’s be honest, pasta is something that we all love, and if you say don’t — you’re lying. Granted, when it comes to pasta, there’s always that one subsequent feeling we’re always left with afterwards, and that feeling is guilt.'

Not only is pasta amazing, and able to go with just about any topping on the planet — it’s also loaded with carbs. So what did we come up with? COSTAPALOR Pasta! A fun, healthy alternative to normal, carby, starchy pasta.

But how did the idea come about?
A few years ago now, we were eating black pasta, you know, the fancy stuff you get at restaurants? As we sat there enjoying its beauty, the idea had hit us. “Wouldn’t it be fun to eat rainbow pasta?” None of us had ever seen it before, and from that moment we were hooked on the idea of it.
Even more so — especially for kids, as they love coloured foods and pasta probably more than us! We were hooked on this idea of tying a brand to pasta, healthy products and something that can be focused around kids, simply because pasta and colours just sounds so fun to eat!

This organic take on a classic is something sure to get kids excited about. And a lot of our design work focused on these aspects as you can see.

So how did we develop the concept?
The world is a colorful place, so why not eat something that resembles that? And that’s an idea we had used when it came to naming this project.

It was really quite fun and simple. Maybe you’ve already figured it out..? COSTAPALOR is simply a rejumbled way of saying pasta-color!

By rearranging the letters, it’s akin to how a child would play with letters and pasta whilst they feast. It’s just another playful element that helped align our branding across this project.

We then took it even further with our brand development and implemented a whole bunch of playful characters. Thanks Arina Shabanova!
A lot of people have asked us if it’s something that we wish could become real and tangible in the future. The answer from us is always yes. We’d actually tried really hard till this point to make it happen.

We’ve looked into distributors, ingredients and everything you could have imagined! And we’re continuing to do so, and we believe once we find the right partners and opportunities, we can still make this happen.
By having the opportunity to create your own product and have all the cards in your hand, it’s a truly awesome feeling. Owning that control and direction from the name, packaging and brand platform is something that we really enjoy being able to work with. Again, we need to mention Arina Shabanova. She was responsible for our characters that you see throughout the branding, which helped us connect the brand. We can’t thank her enough for this.
So what can we say? As of now, we’re at a point where we can say that we’ve spent a lot of time an energy on building this brand and product. We also believe it’s a great idea on many levels, and something that can become real. It may have been 4 years in the making, not to mention a couple of website and branding updates — but we still love it. We could even go as far as saying that this is White Russian’s first ever project.
