We’ve selected a few our favourite past-projects that have been actualized by self initiation. This form of rule-free design, is one of our most effective ways of creating motion graphics without any worries, finding new techniques, and a long the way, picking up some business opportunities. Not to mention, a nice way of even turning a few mistakes into successes.

Let’s get into it.
WRS WIP
The idea behind the video came from a couple of popular recurring questions that people had kept asking us: “Is it 3D?” & “Is it CGI?”

So, we wanted to play on that notion and present a showreel that represented everything as if it were all tangible.
As you can see, the video contains real life footage of us, which we filmed and captured.
The process was incredibly fun. It was the first time we had done anything like this before.
The direction of the video was written solely by us, and we’ve had a lot of positive feedback since, with many people letting us know how much they enjoyed the concept.
This video is still an integral part of our studio today.

Reduced museum
This project was initiated during an internship at CATK, which was great because we’ve been fans of their work for a long time. It’s also one of the most freeform pieces we have in our locker. We’d also like to mention that the textures and audio were all captured in CATK.
The project actually began in 2015, eventually being finished in 2018. It’s an active example of how something can evolve whilst working on a project slowly, and in the background — without any deadlines or rules to follow.
This is our latest large-video production that we’ve completed, and the most abstract to date.
It was a lot of fun working on this one, as it was initiated without knowing what the end result would be.

Since it was started, the concept changed radically, but finally, we ended up with a bunch a really pleasing assets.
We look at Reduced Museum as if it were like stepping into an exhibition full of artefacts — ie. the set of colours, characters and abstract mechanics.

TRIGGER
An earlier version of one of our WIP videos. It was basically used as a starting sequence for the studio’s “beginning”, if you will.
We wanted to create something that gave the illusion of not knowing exactly when or how the video will end.

It was also a study of some new rendering techniques at that particular time, as well as including a lot abstract concepts.
We were working on creating a fake IKEA concept video, so a lot of the inspiration for this stemmed from that previous rendition. And a number of our self initiated ideas have actually turned into external projects.
When clients see the work and enjoyparticular aspects, they often ask to have similar textures or transitions created for their own branding videos etc. So it’s really cool that we have had these opportunities, as well as being able to adapt them accordingly.
Guinness Natural Born
With the idea of creating a mock-up commercial, this video was part of an idea to create a series of big brand videos to find out if anybody would be interested in them.

After a trip to Iceland, we were inspired by the local textures and landscapes, and dedicated the artwork to this classic & world-renowned beer brand. We imagined this dark and rough combination of vulcanic rock coupled with the famous Guinness stout foam.
We were younger back then, and we were hoping that these high profile companies would actually pay us money for these productions!

Naive? Yes.
Our first ever showreel
Our baby. We feel quite sentimental towards this piece, as it’s quite punkish’ and crazy.
It’s definitely not your typical type of showreel. We still wanted to show our personalities and creativity by showcasing real projects, but also wanted it to tell a little story.
This video also worked as a reference for clients, which is fantastic, proving once again the importance of self initiated projects.
