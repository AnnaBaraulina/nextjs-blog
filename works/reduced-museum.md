This project was initiated during an internship at CATK, which was great because we’ve been fans of their work for a long time. It’s also one of the most freeform pieces we have in our locker. We’d also like to mention that the textures and audio were all captured in CATK.
The project actually began in 2015, eventually being finished in 2018. It’s an active example of how something can evolve whilst working on a project slowly, and in the background — without any deadlines or rules to follow.
This is our latest large-video production that we’ve completed, and the most abstract to date.
It was a lot of fun working on this one, as it was initiated without knowing what the end result would be.

Since it was started, the concept changed radically, but finally, we ended up with a bunch a really pleasing assets.
We look at Reduced Museum as if it were like stepping into an exhibition full of artefacts — ie. the set of colours, characters and abstract mechanics.
