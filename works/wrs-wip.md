The idea behind the video came from a couple of popular recurring questions that people had kept asking us: “Is it 3D?” & “Is it CGI?”

So, we wanted to play on that notion and present a showreel that represented everything as if it were all tangible.
As you can see, the video contains real life footage of us, which we filmed and captured.
The process was incredibly fun. It was the first time we had done anything like this before.
The direction of the video was written solely by us, and we’ve had a lot of positive feedback since, with many people letting us know how much they enjoyed the concept.
This video is still an integral part of our studio today.
