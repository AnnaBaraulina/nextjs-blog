With the idea of creating a mock-up commercial, this video was part of an idea to create a series of big brand videos to find out if anybody would be interested in them.
After a trip to Iceland, we were inspired by the local textures and landscapes, and dedicated the artwork to this classic & world-renowned beer brand. We imagined this dark and rough combination of vulcanic rock coupled with the famous Guinness stout foam.
We were younger back then, and we were hoping that these high profile companies would actually pay us money for these productions!

Naive? Yes.
