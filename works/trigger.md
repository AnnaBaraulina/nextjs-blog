An earlier version of one of our WIP videos. It was basically used as a starting sequence for the studio’s “beginning”, if you will.
We wanted to create something that gave the illusion of not knowing exactly when or how the video will end.

It was also a study of some new rendering techniques at that particular time, as well as including a lot abstract concepts.
We were working on creating a fake IKEA concept video, so a lot of the inspiration for this stemmed from that previous rendition. And a number of our self initiated ideas have actually turned into external projects.
When clients see the work and enjoyparticular aspects, they often ask to have similar textures or transitions created for their own branding videos etc. So it’s really cool that we have had these opportunities, as well as being able to adapt them accordingly.
